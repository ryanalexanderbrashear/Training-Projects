//Prompt to request the user enters their name

//Call the function from our InputManager class to get the user input from the keyboard and assign it to a constant (also, uppercase all the letters so that later when we sort the name characters we will get the proper behavior)

var characterArray: [Character] = []

//Add each character in the name string to our character array

//Finally, print out the reversed name
