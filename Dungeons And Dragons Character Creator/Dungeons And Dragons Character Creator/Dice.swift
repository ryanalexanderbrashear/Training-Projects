    func roll() -> Int {
        //arc4random_uniform takes an upper bound value, which we set as our number of sides (converted to a UInt32, a type of integer). Because the random number generated will be in the range 0 to 1 less than the number of sides passed in, so we add 1 to give us the proper range of values as a result (in the case of a six sided die, the range of results should be 1-6). We convert the result to an integer and return it
        let result = arc4random_uniform(UInt32(sides)) + 1
        return Int(result)
    }
